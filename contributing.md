# Introduction


First off, thank you for considering contributing to Hacky API. It's people like you that make our hackathons so amazing!
___ 

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

***

This is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the API itself.

# Ground Rules
### Responsibilities
* Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: pr-checklist.md
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* If any classes have to be added, ensure they have tests with them
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [NPM Community Code of Conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct).

# Your First Contribution
Help people who are new to your project understand where they can be most helpful. This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues.

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

### Bonus points: Add a link to a resource for people who have never contributed to open source before.
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

* Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).  

# Getting started

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Note the NPM Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request following the PR template.

# How to report a bug

##### If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email technology@hackpsu.org instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at technology@hackpsu.org.

### How to file a bug report.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What version of Node are you using (node version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features we have today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

* The tech team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Code style guidelines

* We use Airbnb's code style guide ported by Postmates (See at https://github.com/postmates/typescript and https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
* The code must pass TSLint's style checks before being merged
